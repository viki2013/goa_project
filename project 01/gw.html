    <h1>why goa is good</h1>

    <p>Goal orientation refers to students' reasons for engaging in various achievement behaviors in a particular situation. These reasons may be to learn (a mastery orientation), to do better than others (a performance-approach orientation) or to avoid failure (a performance-avoidance orientation).</p>
 <p>It is the most reliable and the only academy in Georgia that will help you personally and solve any life problem.</p>

 <p>Goa will help you raise better. All this will affect our future. Programming is taught at a high level in Goa. We will improve our academic performance in Goa. In Goa we can earn money with our study and education as well as with determination</p>
<p>Goa was founded in 2019. I started studying in Goa on October 7, 2024. I had my first lesson in Goa exactly on November 7.        The first Galvetil for me was probably the best experience why Goa is good.</p>
