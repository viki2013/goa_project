    <p id="p-1">In the 1940s, the first recognizably modern electrically powered computers were created.<br> The limited speed and memory capacity forced programmers to write hand-tuned assembly language programs.<br> It was eventually realized that programming in assembly language required a great deal of intellectual effort.[citation needed] . <br> An early proposal for a high-level programming language was Plankalk√ºl, developed by Konrad Zuse for his Z1 computer between 1942 and 1945 but not implemented at the time. <br>The first functioning programming languages designed to communicate instructions to a computer were written in the early 1950s.<br> John Mauchly's Short Code, proposed in 1949, was one of the first high-level languages ever developed for an electronic computer.<br> Unlike machine code, Short Code statements represented mathematical expressions in understandable form.<br> However, the program had to be interpreted into machine code every time it ran, making the process much slower than running the equivalent machine code.<br></p>

            
    <p id="p-2">In the early 1950s, Alick Glennie developed Autocode, possibly the first compiled programming language, at the University of Manchester. <br> In 1954, a second iteration of the language, known as the "Mark 1 Autocode", was developed for the Mark 1 by R. A. Brooker. <br> Brooker, with the University of Manchester, also developed an autocode for the Ferranti Mercury in the 1950s.<br> The version for the EDSAC 2 was devised by Douglas Hartree of University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory in 1961. <br> Known as EDSAC 2 Autocode, it was a straight development from Mercury Autocode adapted for local circumstances and was noted for its object code optimization and source-language diagnostics which were advanced for the time. <br> A contemporary but separate thread of development, Atlas Autocode was developed for the University of Manchester Atlas 1 machine. <br> In 1954, FORTRAN was invented at IBM by a team led by John Backus; it was the first widely used high-level general purpose language to have a functional implementation, in contrast to only a design on paper.<br> When FORTRAN was first introduced, it was viewed with skepticism due to bugs, delays in development, and the comparative efficiency of "hand-coded" programs written in assembly.<br> However, in a hardware market that was rapidly evolving, the language eventually became known for its efficiency.<br> It is still a popular language for high-performance computing and is used for programs that benchmark and rank the world's TOP500 fastest supercomputers.<br> </p>
