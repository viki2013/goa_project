    <h1> 1980s: consolidation, modules, performance </h1>

    <p  id="p-5">The 1980s were years of relative consolidation in imperative languages. <br> Rather than inventing new paradigms, all of these movements elaborated upon the ideas invented in the prior decade. C++ combined object-oriented and systems programming. <br> The United States government standardized Ada, a systems programming language intended for use by defense contractors. <br> In Japan and elsewhere, vast sums were spent investigating so-called fifth-generation programming languages that incorporated logic programming constructs. The functional languages community moved to standardize ML and Lisp.  <br>Research in Miranda, a functional language with lazy evaluation, began to take hold in this decade.One important new trend in language design was an increased focus on programming for large-scale systems through the use of modules, or large-scale organizational units of code. <br> Modula, Ada, and ML all developed notable module systems in the 1980s. Module systems were often wedded to generic programming constructs: generics being, in essence, parametrized modules[citation needed] (see also Polymorphism (computer science)). <br> Although major new paradigms for imperative programming languages did not appear, many researchers expanded on the ideas of prior languages and adapted them to new contexts. For example, the languages of the Argus and Emerald systems adapted object-oriented programming to distributed <br> computing systems.The 1980s also brought advances in programming language implementation. The reduced instruction set computer (RISC) movement in computer architecture postulated that hardware should be designed for compilers rather <br> than for human assembly programmers. Aided by central processing unit (CPU) speed improvements that enabled increasingly aggressive compiling methods, the RISC movement sparked greater interest in compiler technology for high-level languages. <br></p>
