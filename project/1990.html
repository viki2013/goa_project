    <h1> 1990s: the Internet age</h1>

    <p id="p-6"> The rapid growth of the Internet in the mid-1990s was the next major historic event in programming languages. <br> By opening up a radically new platform for computer systems, the Internet created an  <br>opportunity for new languages to be adopted. In particular, the JavaScript programming language rose to popularity because of its early integration with the Netscape Navigator web browser. Various other scripting languages achieved widespread use  <br>in developing customized applications for web servers such as PHP. The 1990s saw no fundamental novelty in imperative languages, but much recombination and maturation of old ideas. This era began the spread of functional languages. A big driving philosophy was programmer productivity. <br> Many rapid application development (RAD) languages emerged, which usually came with an integrated development environment (IDE), garbage collection, and were descendants of older languages. All such languages were object-oriented. These included Object Pascal,<br> Objective Caml (renamed OCaml), Visual Basic, and Java. Java in particular received much attention.More radical <br> and innovative than the RAD languages were the new scripting languages. These did not directly descend from other languages and featured new syntaxes and more liberal incorporation of features. <br> Many consider these scripting languages to be more productive than even the RAD languages, <br> but often because of choices that make small programs simpler but large programs more difficult to write and maintain.[citation needed] Nevertheless, scripting languages came <br>to be the most prominent ones used in connection with the Web.Some programming languages included other languages in their distribution to save the development time. for example both of Python <br>and Ruby included Tcl to support GUI programming through libraries like Tkinter.Some notable languages that were developed in this period include: <br></p>
