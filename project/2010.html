    <p id="p-8">Now, let's think for a moment, what would that language look like. ,<br> We cannot just Star Trek ourselves a few years forward, but we can try making an educated guess about it, and getting at least some things right. <br> So my guesses are: It's going to be have support for all the common things people are programming, at language or stdandard library level. That means direct support for: HTTP, TCP/IP, XML, Unicode, i18n. I wouldn't be surprised if it even had AJAX. ,<br> Some languages are already trying to explore this kind of integration. See for example CDuce. Oh yeah, and GUIs are probably not in this category - they are common, but nobody knows how to make a decent portable GUI library (see recent Java GUI issues) <br>.It's going to be simple. C was much simpler than Ada and it won. Java was much simpler than C++ and it won. Ruby is much simpler than Perl and it's winning <br>. Ruby on Rails is much simpler than PHP and J2EE and it's winning. If the language can still surprise you after a few months of using it, has ugly corner cases, and many things that "kinda work, but not always", it means huge loss of productivity.It will cooperate with the outside world. <br> You know what was great about Perl ? You never had to care about dealing with the outside, you could support even the weirdest interfaces with just a few lines of code and get back to coding the real thing. If the outside world changed completely, <br> you needed a few minutes to make your program work again.  It will give a damn about security. Most programs run on insecure networks. Take a look at some existing programming languages - C is just great for crackers - it makes writing stack smashing friendly code so easy.<br> And PHP is so SQL injection friendly. I wouldn't be very surprised if the authors of C and PHP were member of <br> CIA or some other GNAA trying to make people write insecure code so they can exploit it. But people are smarter now, and I think the language of 2010 will make it easy and natural to write secure code.It won't give a damn about performance. Designing for performance is root <br>of all evil. All languages designed for performance suck. You can get most of the performance later. For God's sake, even Java is faster than C++ these days. The language's only ahead-of-time compiler will probably be JIT compiler running in a hacked mode. It will be<br> dynamically typed and completely object oriented, kinda like Ruby. It will also have high-order functions and metaprogramming, kinda like Ruby.<br></p>
